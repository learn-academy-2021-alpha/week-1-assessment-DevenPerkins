# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a block of code that takes information and runs tasks with logic, of varying complexities in one execution instead of having to repeat the multiple lines of code for each time you want to run the task. 

  Researched answer: A function is a block of code that has a set of systematic instructions that executes a task over and over again with the same conditions to make a consistent determination of the inputted data. Creating a function helps to prevent the instructions from having to be typed out each time the user wants to run that data set again.



2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer: Before I talk about the differences I would like to point out the similarity between the two. Both .map() and .array() will iterate(loop) through the array that the function is added to. The difference between .map() and .filter() is that .map() will return an array of the same length, but with the values in the array having the instructed modification. .Filter() could return an array of the same length. Given that the values in the array satisfy the conditions of the .filter() function. .filter() is typically used to remove data that does not meet the conditions provided. .filter() essentially has a built-in "if" statement.

  Researched answer: The difference between .map() and .filter() is that .map will create an array of the same length of the array it's acting on. .filter will return a subset of the array that it is acting on.


3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: The difference between console.log() and return is that return will not show up in the terminal when it is called and is typically used inside of a function. console.log is used to call a variable and or a function to be printed in the terminal. In summary, return in for internal work and console.log is to display the result of the program that is being called on.

  Researched answer: The difference between console.log() and return is that return is used to help end the running of a function whereas consol.log() is a function and is used to call on a variable or a function with the use of a variable as an argument.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: An argument is data that is evaluated in a function as the input. With the purpose being to get an output with all of the instructions in the function being run on the argument.

  Researched answer: It is a piece of outside information that is inputted into a function to make the function work and provide the outcomes stated within the function.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Proper pair programming entails letting each person in the group have an equal share of each position and be able to fully execute the position. What this means is that each person in the pair will able to be a navigator and a driver and be able to contribute in a way that their position describes.

 The driver is the one who is typing the pseudocode and code into the editor and is calling it in the terminal. The navigator is the one who is reading the challenge over and is directing the driver on what to type.

  Researched answer: Constant and clear communication is key for pair programming. The navigator must be clear in their instruction to the driver when reading the challenge and on what they should be typing. It's just as equally important that the driver can take clear communication and put that into the editor as they are the ones with their hands on the keyboard.



6. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is another way of saying looping though. Iteration involves looping through each item in an array to get information from the array or make adjustments to the array.

  Researched answer: The process of looping through each item in an array to complete a repetitive task on multiple items of varying value.



7. What are advantages and disadvantages for using terminal commands to interact with your computer?

  Your answer: Advantages being you're having direct communication with your computer without any programs getting in the way. You're able to navigate through file structures and quickly create new directories. Disadvantages are that there is a steep learning curve when it comes to familiarizing yourself with the commands. The interface is not as elegant or user-friendly. There is a chance the wrong command could be typed in on accident causing errors on your computer.ng you're having direct communication with your 

  Researched answer:Advantages being you will have direct communication with your computer, more control over programs, gain access to built-in functionality, and have access to commands that you cannot do in your GUI. Few of those commands being git commands and version managers. The command terminal is resource-light, freeing up some of that precious RAM. It looks cool too. It will look like you know how the matrix works and that you're able to manipulate it.

  The disadvantages being you need to know what you're doing when using the terminal. There is not much room for error and if you mess up something you may have to start from scratch. There is a steep learning curve.



8. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: The introduction and explanation of pseudocoding. It had been instrumental in helping me organize my thoughts and also helps provide clear communication to someone who is reading my code for the first time.
